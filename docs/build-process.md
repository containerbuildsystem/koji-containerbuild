1. User calls `buildContainer` XMLRPC call â€• e.g. by `container-build` command
   of `rpkg`
1. Hub XMLRPC handler `buildContainer` creates `buildContainer` method
1. Builder method `buildContainer`
   1. Checks that target and SCM are correct
   1. Checks that build with given NVR doesn't exist (unless it's a scratch or
      autorelease task)
